<h1>My Favorite Cars</h1>
<h4>2019 Volkswagen Golf R</h4>
<img src="images/golf-r.jpg" alt="2019 Volkswagen Golf R">
<p>The all-wheel-drive Golf R is motivated by a potent turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four—making 
    288 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque—mated to either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed 
    dual-clutch automatic transmission.</p>

<h4>2022 Mini Cooper John Cooper Works</h4>

<p>The 2022 Mini Cooper John Cooper Works Hardtop arrives on the scene with fresh styling influenced 
    by the changes made to the regular vehicle, but also includes some bespoke upgrades. A larger front 
    grille and better cooling ducts enhance performance, as does an optional adaptive suspension system. 
    This is complemented by a redesigned rear diffuser, but no more power is extracted from the 
    2.0-liter turbo-four. You still get 228 horsepower and the ability to hit 60 mph in six seconds, 
    but now you can do it in a choice of two new colors as well.</p>
